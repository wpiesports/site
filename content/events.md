**August 31st**
WPI Esports Kickoff!!!
# Kickoff

Exec is very happy to announce our first event of the year, the first (hopefully annual) **WPI Esports Kickoff!** This will be a chance to everyone to meet other players, talk to exec, and learn more about the club. And eat free pizza. This is open to anyone, whether or not they're interested in playing on a team.

Kickoff will start at **3pm on August 31st**, in the East Hall lounge + Esports Lab. We'll have a variety of mini-tournaments for different games to help people get familiar with the new space. At 4pm, we'll do a lil introduction + official kickoff, and then more gaming until the pizza arrives.

We're really excited to do this and hope it can be the start of a great new tradition, so please stop by, bring your friends, and have a good time!
