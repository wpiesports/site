# Esports at WPI
WPI has been competing in esports for over 6 years in a wide range of titles. With over 150 members participating on teams, the club supports a wide range of competition and skill levels. We also find opportunities for members to get involved in other areas of esports like broadcasting, coaching, or managing teams. We're always looking to build on our teams and the opportunities we provide to WPI students.
