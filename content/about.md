# Esports at WPI
WPI has been competing in esports for over 10 years in a wide range of titles. We currently support 7 games with over 150 members participating on teams, and over 1000 students in our community. We also find opportunities for members to get involved in other areas of esports like broadcasting, coaching, or managing teams. We're always looking to build on our teams and the opportunities we provide to WPI students.
